# Summary
The visualization describes the relationship between bins of batting averages (spaced out by .025), home runs (averaged for each bin of batting averages), and a batter's handedness (Right, Left, or Switch).  The goal is to see if there are any trends related to these three variables.

## Initial Design Decisions
###Chart Type

Originally, I created a scatter plot with the averages and home runs since these both represented quantitative data.  The resulting scatter plot was very busy, and it was not easy to see any relationships.  I made the decision to group averages into bins of .025 in order to help organize the scatter plot.  I decided to add a line to the scatter plot to help highlight the trends.
